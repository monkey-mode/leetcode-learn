## Problem Description
For more details, you can visit the [LeetCode Problem Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/).

Given a string `expression` consisting of numbers and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`), the goal is to compute all possible results by grouping the numbers and operators in all possible valid ways. Return all unique results in **any order**.

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`expression = "2-1-1"`

**Output:**  
`[0, 2]`

**Explanation:**  
- `((2-1)-1) = 0`  
- `(2-(1-1)) = 2`

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`expression = "2*3-4*5"`

**Output:**  
`[-34, -14, -10, -10, 10]`

**Explanation:**  
- `(2*(3-(4*5))) = -34`  
- `((2*3)-(4*5)) = -14`  
- `((2*(3-4))*5) = -10`  
- `(2*((3-4)*5)) = -10`  
- `(((2*3)-4)*5) = 10`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= expression.length <= 20`
- The expression consists of digits and the operators `+`, `-`, and `*`.
- All the integer values in the input expression are in the range `[0, 99]`.

## Approach

This solution utilizes **recursion** to explore all possible ways to compute the result by breaking down the expression into smaller parts. The key idea is to split the expression at every operator, calculate the left and right subexpressions recursively, and combine the results.

### Steps:
1. **Backtracking**: For each operator, the expression is split into left and right parts, and both are recursively evaluated.
2. **Combine Results**: The results from the left and right parts are combined using the operator found.
3. **Base Case**: If the expression is a single number, return that number.

## Solution Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def diffWaysToCompute(self, expression: str) -> List[int]:
        # Dictionary to map operators to their respective operations
        operations = {
            "+": lambda x, y: x + y,
            "-": lambda x, y: x - y,
            "*": lambda x, y: x * y
        }

        # Backtracking helper function
        def backtrack(left, right):
            res = []

            for i in range(left, right):
                op = expression[i]
                if op not in operations:
                    continue

                # Recursively calculate results for left and right subexpressions
                num1 = backtrack(left, i)
                num2 = backtrack(i + 1, right)

                # Combine the results of both subexpressions using the operator
                for n1 in num1:
                    for n2 in num2:
                        res.append(operations[op](n1, n2))
            
            # Base case: if no operators are found, it must be a number
            if not res:
                res.append(int(expression[left:right]))
            return res

        return backtrack(0, len(expression))
```

## Explanation of Code

1. **Operations Dictionary**: The `operations` dictionary maps each operator (`+`, `-`, `*`) to a corresponding lambda function to perform the computation.
2. **Backtrack Function**: This function recursively evaluates sub-expressions. It splits the expression into left and right parts at each operator, calculates all possible results for both sides, and combines them.
3. **Base Case**: If no operators are found in the current segment, it is treated as a number and added to the result list.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N * 2^N), where N is the length of the expression. This accounts for the number of different ways to split the expression.
- **Space Complexity**: O(2^N) due to the recursive call stack and the space required for storing results.
